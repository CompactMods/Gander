# Gander: A world-to-screen rendering library

Provides multiple small modules to get the common problem of "how do I render a fake world/multiblock" out of modders' hands. Stop wasting time making rendering utilities; let Gander deal with that.

Modules:

- **core**: basic files, needed for rendering + ui
- **levels**: a virtual level implementation
- **rendering**: a render baking and optimization layer
- **ui**: widgets for showing stuff on a screen
